# APIs-and-routingpy
Using the routingpy python module, you can use APIs from various sources (including HereMaps, Google, Mapbox, ORS and more) to plot interactive isochrones and direction routes, which can be projected onto a Folium Map.
<br> To create your own similar interactive plots, you'll first need to pip install routingpy and pip install folium.
<br> You'll then need to generate your own API key from any of the supported APIs which can be read by routingpy.
<br> Here is the documentation you can use for reference https://routingpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
<br> To view my interactive outputs, you can open the notebook externally using nbviewer.
